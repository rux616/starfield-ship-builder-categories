This mod does nothing on its own
=====
It must be paired with other mods that actually utilize the added category keywords.

Summary
-----
This mod is pretty much what it says on the tin, but does nothing on its own. It adds a number of keywords that are then available for use in other mods. It also adds these keywords to its own Ship Builder category list, and changes a couple other records so that the game uses this new Ship Builder category list (SBC_ShipModuleRecipeCategories [FLST:02000A2A]). The goal is to (hopefully) keep mods from stepping on one another in regards to category editing. Because this mod is meant to be a community resource, it will always have donations disabled and remain opted out of DP.

Mod Authors: Do you have a category you want included? Let's do it! Contact me and we can make it happen.

This is a limited version of the README. The full version, including a list of all categories, can be found at the mod's GitHub repository (https://github.com/rux616/starfield-ship-builder-categories).

Compatibility
-----
Will conflict with other mods that do their own edits to the Spaceship All Category List default object (SpaceshipAllCategoryList_DO [DFOB:002A39C9]) or the Recipe Manager List form ID list (RecipeManagerList [FLST:002C59D7]).

Known Issues
-----
None
